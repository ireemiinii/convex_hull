# convex_hull

I created an algorithm by examining the jarvis-march algorithm and watching the reference video. I explained the steps I have made with the comment lines in the code I will send in the attachment.

I think the biggest factor in using convex-hull is that it allows collecting multiple data with the same properties in the point data we have and examining them with a common polygon. For example, in photogrammetry, we can define the roof of a house with a polygon or convex shape so that we can see the common colors from examining the satellite photo. This allows us to examine and classify objects that are similar to us or have the same properties in a shorter time. The data in vector format represents the real situation by joining points and lines. Polygons can also be created by combining these. Thus, complex shapes or features can be defined more easily in vector format since the necessary details can be created.
